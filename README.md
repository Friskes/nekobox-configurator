## nekobox-helper
### The program to simplify interaction with nekobox android client: [NekoBoxForAndroid](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid)

1. Create a nekobox android configuration file for separate tunneling (Only addresses from the file will be proxied).

2. Convert a file with ip addresses from the amnesia format to the nekobox format (The file in the amnesia format can be generated by following the link: [iplist](https://iplist.opencck.org/)).

> You can use my personal file with the ip addresses that I have attached to the repository: `ip4_youtube_chatgpt_jetbrains.txt`
