## nekobox-helper
### A CLI for creating a configuration of the [NekoBoxForAndroid](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid) for separate tunneling and other related utilities

1. Create a nekobox android configuration file for separate tunneling for vless protocol (Only addresses from the file will be proxied).

2. Convert a file with ip addresses from the amnesia format to the nekobox format (The file in the amnesia format can be generated by following the link: [iplist](https://iplist.opencck.org/)).

> You can use my personal file with the ip addresses that I have attached to the repository (youtube, chatgpt, jetbrains services): `ip4_youtube_chatgpt_jetbrains.txt`
